# 🧠 JS Development Questions Practice for Logical Thinking

Welcome to my personal repository where I practise JavaScript development questions to strengthen my **problem-solving** and **logical thinking** skills. 💪  

This repository contains questions from easy to pro levels, covering concepts like strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals — all implemented using pure JavaScript.

Each file includes:
- Problem statement  
- Example input/output  
- My logic and approach  
- Clean, well-commented JavaScript code

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Strings
- Arrays
- Loops & Iteration
- Functions
- Conditionals
- ES6 Features (map, filter, reduce)
